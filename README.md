# Comprehensive-Analysis-and-Quantification-of-Key-Performance-Metrices-of-SWIPT-System.
This Repo contains the Analysis work and mathematical derivations that has been carried out of efficient data transfer and power transfer in "Simultaneous Wireless Power and Information Transfer" system.  
This project aimed at analysis of the developing reaseach topic SWIPT system.
In this project we derived the matematical equations for the SNR,BER and outage probabilty analysis of the SWIPYT system in a AWGN channel.
This project is done using SIMULINK where we designed a SWIPT model.
The performance matrices are quantified using the MATLAB programs.
We also worked on the quantification on the a energy harvesting point where the BER is also low and the the energy conversion effieceny was nearly 90%.
More detailed explanation of the project can be understood by reading the IEEE report i had made.
