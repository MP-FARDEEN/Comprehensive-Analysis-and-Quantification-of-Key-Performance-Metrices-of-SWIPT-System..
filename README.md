# Comprehensive-Analysis-and-Quantification-of-Key-Performance-Metrices-of-SWIPT-System.
This Repo contains the Analysis work and mathematical derivations that has been carried out of efficient data transfer and power transfer in "Simultaneous Wireless Power and Information Transfer" system.  
This project aimed at analysis of the developing reaseach topic SWIPT system.In this project we derived the matematical equations for the SNR,BER and outage probabilty analysis of the SWIPYT system in a AWGN channel. This project is done using SIMULINK where we designed a SWIPT model. The performance matrices are quantified using the MATLAB programs. We also worked on the quantification on the a energy harvesting point where the BER is also low and the the energy conversion effieceny was nearly 90%.
To perform the Experimental analysis of the system, Monte Carlo simulation runs has been performed. which gave a near theorectical plot resemblence for the SNR vs BER and outatge probabilty plot. 
This project has a future scope in which the comunication engineers can develop and test the various wireless channel, here Rayliegh channel is begin modelled in the mathematical equations.

This project was done in two phases
1. In the first phase, the SWIPT system is modelled in the MATLAB and observed how the signal is processed and the effect of different power splitting ratio that would effect the energy harvesting and the information decoding rate.
2. In the second phase, the mathematicaly modelled was derived considering the factors that effects the wireless communication. And the required theorectical and experimental results are plotted and comapred.

More info about this project can be understood from the IEEE report as well the phase wise report provided.
